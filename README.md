## Introduction

This package provides high-quality icons used throughout XIUI elements.  
It was created as a combination of passion and inspiration.

I originally started working on this icon project three years ago for the old addon called **XIVhotbar2**, but it was left unfinished. Recently, I learned that the author is now expanding the addon by adding a **XIVhotbar2-inspired hotbar system**—one that is much better and cleaner. This inspired me to resume and complete this icon package.

Today, I am finally releasing the first part of this project.

## To Do List

This package currently contains mostly **SMN** icons. I have plans to cover a few additional jobs and categories, but for others, I do not yet have concrete plans—so no promises there.

This list will be updated as I make progress. Priority is listed in the following order:
**currently in progress → soon → indefinite**

### Jobs

- **Summoner** *(RELEASED — will be updated)*
  - Diabolos *(currently in progress)*
  - Merit abilities *(soon)*
  - Avatar abilities beyond level 75 *(indefinite)*

## Installation

Please read the [XIUI addon's installation guide](https://github.com/tirem/XIUI).

If the addon does not work, please double-check the installation steps before opening a new issue or contacting the author.

## Other Jobs and Miscellaneous

As mentioned above, I cannot make promises for content I do not currently plan to work on.

Some of you may already know this, but **XIUI already includes official FFXIV icons** for other jobs. Many of these share abilities and weaponskills with FFXI, which is why I designed these icons to match the **frame and reflective style** of the official FFXIV icons—allowing them to blend seamlessly with existing assets.

To make customization easier, I’ve included the latest **Photoshop template** in this package. This serves as a quick starting point for anyone who wants to create and insert their own images using the icon template. If you’d prefer the layers to be exported as individual images instead of a single file, feel free to let me know.

For anything else you may want to know, I plan to open new accounts on a few platforms to share my work.  
Stay tuned!
